		<p style="color: yellow">22 movies. Every unique story. Let's start from the beginning. Tony Stark, The Iron Man.. Son of Howard Stark, a billionare genius and inventor, and now that's what he is. But after he was kidnapped by some terrorists, he realises the consequences of his weapon making industry. He almost died, he had some shrapnel stuck in his chest that would have killed him, but if it wasn't for his friend Yinsen who was kidnapped too, he would have died. He now makes armors for himself, and saves the world using them.</p>
		<br>
		<p style="color: darkgreen">Bruce Banner. A scientist who got stuck in the middle of a nuclear explosion, turning him into this powerhouse which can smash almost anything. He's known as The Hulk. He has anger issues on a massive scale, but he's a good person who smashes any villain in his way.</p>
		<br>
		<p style="color: grey">The Norse God of Thunder, living in a gold palace on a planet called Asgard. He was about to recieve the throne of Asgard from his father, Odin, The All Father. However, he was interrupted by a Frost Guard right before he was crowned. Thor's arrogance lead him to taking on all of the army, and escaped at the last second. Odin found out and banished him to Earth with the  powerful hammer called Mljnir. That would have been his if his arrogance didn't overcome him. After that, his brother,  Loki, tried to take over, but Thor learnt from his mistakes and his arrogance and was worth to take his hammer back, and stop Loki.
		<br>
		<p style="color: lightblue">Steve Rogers- a guy from Brooklyn in the 1940's trying to make it as a soldier...but he's not exactly in shape for it. He has the compassion, the kindness, and the spirit. But not the strength. Luckily for him, the doctor who wanted him to become a soldier gave him a super soldier serum, giving him enhanced strength, speed, and agility. From that point on, he was Captain America. The doctor only asked that Steve would stay the man he is, before he died to a bullet from Hydra, a tyrant organization which wants to rule the world, led by the Red Skull, who had a weapon of cosmic power.. Steve got frozen in ice for 70 years by saving his city by defeating Red Skull, and diving a bomb into the ice which would have blew up Manhattan.After those 70 years, he was found,and the serum kept him alive, and his body or mind didn't age. He didn't know he would get his first mission very soon, but he thought wrong...</p> 

		<p style="color: blue">An army was on their way. Going to invade earth. Sent by Thanos. A tyrant who sees the world as flawed, imperfect, in need of correcting.The item of cosmic power in Captain America's story was called the Tesseract. The tesseract allowed Loki to open the portal in which the Chitauri invade earth. Nick Fury, Director of the Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement and Logistics Division(S.H.I.E.L.D) formed a team out of Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye.This project was called the Avengers Initiative. It was a project to bring the most remarkable people on earth to form a team that would need to save the Earth one day. It was formed right after Captain Marvel, who made Fury aware that their enemies stretched far out from Earth. The team stopped the invaders and put Loki in Asgsrd's custody. They didn't know about Thanos yet though. And they still didn't know what was inside the Tesseract. Or Loki's sceptre...</p>
		<br>
		<p style="color: darkred">After a rough 3 years, the Avengers are still fighting together. S.H.I.E.L.D had collapsed. Iron Man had been suffering from PTSD. Thor lost his mother, and he thought he lost his brother too. Steve and Natasha(Black Widow) had just been in one of their most dangerous fights, it was against Steve's closest friend who was brainwashed and everyone thought who was dead: The Winter Soldier, who was actually James Buchanan Barnes. Clint Barton(Hawkeye) was just injured in a fight against two enhanced individuals. Pietro and Wanda Maximoff. They needed peace of their time. Tony and Bruce tried to accomplish this by making an AI that would help the world but it ended in a catastrophic result. Ultron. A sentient maniac who wanted to replace humans with robots because Ultron saw them as flawed. He couldn't be beat unless the Avengers had one last trick up their sleeve. But it was actually Tony and Bruce. They took one more shot, using Loki's spear and a cradle which creates regenerative tissue, but the programmed it to make a body. When VISION came to life, he had the Mind Stone in his head. The Mind Stone was one of the 6 infinity stones which are the most powerful objects in the universe. There was one for Mind. One for Time. Space. Soul. Reality. Power. These were the stones that Thanos were out to get, and eliminate half the population of the universe with, but they didn't know that yet. Vision was going to help them beat Ultron. And that's what happened.</p>
		<br>
		<p style="color: gold">Another attempt from Thanos to get the infinity stones were throught Ronan, who was to obtain the Power Stone and give it to him, and in return he would destroy Xandar for Ronan. Unfortunately he was apprehended by the Guardians of The Galaxy, and the stone was given to the Nova Corps for safekeeping. That's when Thanos realised that the only one who could collect all the infinity stones was himself. He would obtain the infinity gauntlet and complete his destiny.</p>
		<br>
		<p style="color: purple;"> 4 years later. Quick recap of everything that happened. Captain America and Iron Man had a disagreement and it involved in the Avengers(apart from Thor and Hulk) and a few new characters, Falcon, Ant-Man, Spider-Man and Black Panther. Thor had found Hulk and Asgard had been destroyed. Captain America and his team went into hiding for 2 years.  Until Thanos had arrived on Earth. At Black Panther's home(Wakanda), and on Thanos' home planet, Titan, all the heroes had faced Thanos and they lost. Spider Man, Iron Man, Doctor Strange and the Guardians of the Galazy had fought Thanos and lost against him. The final hope was in the hands of the people at Wakanda. It wasn't enough. Thanos got to Vision and got the last stone from his head, and with the snap of his fingers, half the universe had perished.
		5 years later.
		Tony had found a way to time travel and they had a chance of bringing everyone back. They had one shot. And they did it. They returned with all the infinity stones and Hulk snapped everyone who died 5 years ago back into existence. However, when they all returned, there was one problem. The Nebula that returned with them wasn't the Nebula of their time. It was the 2014 Nebula who wanted to please her father. Her father was Thanos. Nebula managed to get Thanos into 2020, and the final fight began. </p>

		<p style="color: black">The fight was over. Tony had used the infinity stones to snap Thanos' army out of existence, including him. But the power was too much for a human. He died saving everyone. But he left a legacy. A legacy which all the Avengers will honour.</p>
