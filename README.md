Smaowl Project
# marvel-thing
Something which shows the storyline of all the marvel movies over 22 movies and 10 years
I have used html and css to code this and I wanted to do this because I've liked marvel for quite a while and I had a project to do for a class, so I thought why not go for the thing that I like the most
I have input tables, links, pictures, an infographic and also a picture showing the whole timeline in order of the marvel movies and series there have been.
It is my first project and I tried my best. I could have done better with visualization a bit more. It is alright apart from that. I've used Sublime text to make this and I've
used javascript in it too. I thoroughly enjoyed putting out all my knowledge of marvel. If you haven't watched Avengers Endgame (you probably have but still) don't go onto the Storyline 
of this website because it contains spoilers for it.
